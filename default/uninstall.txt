Heres how to uninstall
Since unisntallation involves removing it is much more sensitive than installation, so I leave a txt instruction.

1. remove binary
sudo rm ~/go/bin/byodns

2. remove assets directory 
sudo rm -rf /etc/byodns

3. disable service
sudo systemctl stop byodns.service
sudo systemctl disable byodns.service


if you want redis to be disabled, or uninstalled
sudo systemctl stop redis-server.service
sudo systemctl disable redis-server.service

sudo apt remove redis-server #If you want to uninstall redis-server only
sudo apt autoremove redis-server #If you want to uninstall all the stuff that
comes with redis-server

sudo rm -rf /lib/systemd/system/redis* #If you have other service named redis,
don't do this command because it will be deleted
sudo rm -rf /etc/systemd/system/redis* #same above


4. remove files
sudo rm -rf /lib/systemd/system/byodns.service 
sudo rm -rf /etc/systemd/system/byodns.service 


(6). remove package #not so necessary
When building source code, other third party is installed automatically.
remove package you don't need
sudo rm -rf ~/go/pkg/<path to package>

5. remove repo
sudo rm -rf <path to repo cloned>
